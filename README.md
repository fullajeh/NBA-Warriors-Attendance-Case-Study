# 🏀 Fan Attendance & Profitability Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This case study analyzes the relationship between **team performance**, **fan attendance**, and **profitability** over multiple seasons.  
The goal was to uncover **actionable insights** into how winning seasons impact ROI, fan loyalty, and long-term support strategies.  

By using Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, I transformed raw attendance and financial data into a story recruiters, sports analysts, and business leaders can relate to.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- 📈 **Winning seasons drive higher attendance** and correlate with stronger profitability.  
- 📉 **Losing seasons reduce fan turnout**, highlighting the importance of retention strategies.  
- 💡 Attendance trends can guide **ticket pricing, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation**.  
- ⚖️ Comparing **team vs. league averages** revealed how biased datasets can distort conclusions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- **Data Visualization** for trend discovery and storytelling
